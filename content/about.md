Welcome to the front end for the Four Dunce Cappers ML application. This software is powered by a convuluted nueral networked trained to recognize gematria patterns between sports match ups. It uses a variety of weights to calculate and transform the final mathematical output. This implements what's called an unsupervised learning algortithm. The system needs an intial dataset in the form of a Google Sheet or xls or cvs file of the upcoming game schedule in the format [home] [away] [date] if there is extra data such as pitcher data that will be added to the calculation. This calculates the predictions for the whole season and recalculates certain weights as the games approach game time (for example weather calucations can change day of/night of).
